"I can't actually do this anymore. My body won't take it much more. 

"I don't want [the cancer] creeping back again.
And all the traveling involved in Sabbath tours increasingly takes its toll.
That's why we're going out on one last tour, to say our farewells.
And then it very definitely is the end. We won't be doing it again."

"We've been doing this for getting on for 50 years now.
It's about time we draw the line, don't you think?
It's been great but it's time to stop now."

He continued that, while he still loved gigging,
it was the traveling that exhausted him:

"Don't get me wrong, I still love gigging. 
It's all the traveling and the exhaustion that goes with it that's the problem. 
That side of things has a big impact on me.
Yes, we may fly in luxury, stay in the very best hotels, 
ride in the most comfortable limos,
but there's still a physical cost to touring. 
Even when we build in rest breaks - I have to have blood
tests every six weeks - I find it tough going. 
You take a long haul flight,
arrive somewhere at five in the morning and book into a hotel. 
There's the soundcheck, the promotional work, the gig itself,
then you're back at the hotel to collapse into bed. 
Then next day you get to do it all over again."
